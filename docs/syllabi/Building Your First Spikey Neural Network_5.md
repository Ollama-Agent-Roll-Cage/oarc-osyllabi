# Machine Learning Curriculum (Pioneer Level)

## Overview

Here's an overview of Machine Learning (ML) at the Pioneer skill level:

**What is Machine Learning?**

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to automatically learn from data, improve their performance on tasks, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**: Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data, where the output is already known. Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in unlabeled data.
2. **Types of Machine Learning**:
	* **Regression**: predicting a continuous value (e.g., house prices).
	* **Classification**: predicting a categorical value (e.g., spam vs not spam emails).
	* **Clustering**: grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).
3. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: popular algorithms include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: preparing data for ML tasks, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and normalization.

**Applications of Machine Learning:**

1. **Image Classification**: recognizing objects in images (e.g., self-driving cars).
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: text analysis and sentiment analysis.
3. **Recommendation Systems**: suggesting products or services based on user behavior.
4. **Predictive Maintenance**: predicting equipment failures to prevent downtime.

**Pioneer-Level Machine Learning Tasks:**

1. **Building a simple ML model** using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
2. **Exploring and visualizing data** using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
3. **Implementing basic ML algorithms**, such as Linear Regression or Decision Trees.

**Learning Resources for Pioneers:**

1. **Books**: "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng and Michael I. Jordan, "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka.
2. **Online Courses**: Coursera's Machine Learning course, edX's Machine Learning Essentials.
3. **Tutorials and Guides**: Kaggle's ML tutorials, towardsdatascience.com.

This overview should provide a solid foundation for Pioneers to start exploring the world of Machine Learning!
