2. **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Advanced metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and AUC-ROC are used to evaluate model performance.
3. **Overfitting and Regularization**: Techniques to prevent overfitting, including regularization methods like L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Methods for optimizing hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization.
5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to improve performance, including bagging, boosting, and stacking.

**Advanced Machine Learning Techniques:**

1. **Deep Learning**: Using neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in data.
