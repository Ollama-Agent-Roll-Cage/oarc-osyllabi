# Machine Learning Curriculum (Intermediate Level)

## Overview

Here's an overview of machine learning at the intermediate level:

**What is Machine Learning?**

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In other words, machine learning enables computers to improve their performance on a task over time based on experience.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Supervised Learning:** This type of learning involves training an algorithm on labeled data, where the correct output is already known. The goal is to learn a mapping between input and output variables.
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** In this type of learning, algorithms are trained on unlabeled data, where the relationships or patterns in the data need to be discovered.
3. **Overfitting:** When an algorithm performs too well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data, it's said to overfit. Regularization techniques can help prevent overfitting.
4. **Hyperparameters:** These are parameters that are set before training a model and can affect its performance.

**Machine Learning Workflow:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant and high-quality data for training the algorithm.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.
3. **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate algorithm based on the problem type and dataset characteristics.
4. **Model Training:** Feeding the preprocessed data to the selected algorithm and adjusting its parameters as needed.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.

**Machine Learning Algorithms:**

Some popular machine learning algorithms include:

1. **Decision Trees:** A tree-like structure used for classification and regression tasks.
2. **Random Forests:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictions.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** A linear or nonlinear model used for classification and regression tasks.
4. **Neural Networks:** Inspired by biological neural networks, these models are composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process inputs.

**Common Machine Learning Tasks:**

1. **Classification:** Assigning a class label to new data based on its features.
2. **Regression:** Predicting continuous values for new data based on its features.
3. **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points into clusters without prior knowledge of their classes.

**Machine Learning Tools and Libraries:**

Some popular tools and libraries used in machine learning include:

1. **Scikit-learn:** A Python library providing a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, etc.
2. **TensorFlow:** An open-source framework developed by Google for large-scale numerical computation.
3. **PyTorch:** Another popular deep learning framework that provides automatic differentiation and dynamic computation graphs.

This overview should give you a solid understanding of the key concepts and workflow involved in machine learning at an intermediate level.
